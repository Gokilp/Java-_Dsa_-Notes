# Classes

- class is like a blue print
- classes Named group of properities and function
- classes is used combined properties and Methods

## Why need Class

Consider a scenario where we need to manage information about students, such as their roll numbers and names. Initially, we might resort to separate arrays for each piece of data:

```java
javaCopy code
int[] rollNumbers = new int[5]; // Array for storing roll numbers
String[] names = new String[5]; // Array for storing student names

```

While this approach works, it can quickly become unwieldy as the program grows. Every additional piece of data necessitates another array, leading to increased memory consumption and complex data management. Classes offer a more elegant solution by consolidating related data and behavior into a single entity.
