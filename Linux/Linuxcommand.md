# Terminal

A terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer system, typically through a command-line interface (CLI). It allows users to input commands and receive textual output, enabling tasks like file manipulation, process management, and system configuration. Terminal emulators replicate this functionality on modern graphical user interfaces (GUI).

# Shell

A shell is a command-line interface program that interprets user commands to interact with an operating system. It acts as an intermediary, executing commands and managing system resources. Shells offer features like scripting, input/output redirection, and piping, making them powerful tools for system administration and development.

Common Unix/Linux shells include Bash, Zsh, Fish, Ksh, and Csh, each with its own syntax and capabilities. Users can customize their shell environments for improved productivity and workflow efficiency.
