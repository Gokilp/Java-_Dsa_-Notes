# Terminal

A terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer system, typically through a command-line interface (CLI). It allows users to input commands and receive textual output, enabling tasks like file manipulation, process management, and system configuration. Terminal emulators replicate this functionality on modern graphical user interfaces (GUI).

# shell

A shell is a command-line interface program that interprets user commands to interact with an operating system. It acts as an intermediary, executing commands and managing system resources. Shells offer features like scripting, input/output redirection, and piping, making them powerful tools for system administration and development.

 Common Unix/Linux shells include Bash, Zsh, Fish, Ksh, and Csh, each with its own syntax and capabilities. Users can customize their shell environments for improved productivity and workflow efficiency.

# Enviornment Variables

Environment variables are dynamic values stored within a system, used by applications in shells or sub-shells. They customize system performance and application behavior. The environment serves as the interface for a computer application to interact with the system. Environment variables contain information such as default applications, system locally, executable file paths, keyboard layout settings, etc., making applications available according to the system's configuration.

# PATH

In Linux, the "PATH" is an environment variable that lists directories containing executable files. When you type a command, the system searches these directories to find the corresponding executable. Customizing the PATH allows users to run programs from any location in the terminal.

# Commands Linux

```java
pwd  //print working directory
```
