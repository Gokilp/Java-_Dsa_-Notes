## Stack Memory

```java
int a = 10 
```

When we declare a variable so, hence the reference variable is stored in stack Memory 

## Heap Memory

Reference Variable stored in stack Memory is printing in heap memory

## Memory allocation

- Memory allocation specifices the memory addres to a program
- Two Types
- Heap Memory
- Stack Memory

## Garbage  collection

- More than one  reference Variable can to the same object
- It any changes made of in the object of reference variable that will be reflected all other pointing to the same object.
- if there is an object without referecence variablr then the object will be distracted by  garbage collection

## String considering 2 types

- Immutable
- pool

pool ⇒ pool is an pointing a different variable referced same objects 

Immutable ⇒  String values does not change values value create  a object and not referenced varaible deleted garbage value
