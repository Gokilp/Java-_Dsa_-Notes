# Types programming Language

- procedural programming Language
- Functional programming Language
- Object-oriented programming Language

# procedural programming Language

- specifies a series of well-structured steps and procdurces to compose a program
- contains  a systematic order of staments,functions and commands to complete a task

# Functional Programming Language

- writing a program only in pure function never modifies variable,but only creates new ones as an Output
- used in  situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data like ml. first class function

# Object-oriented programming Language

Revolves around objects 

code + data = object 

Method+ properties = object 

Developed to make it easier to develop, debug, reuse and maintain software

# Static vs Dynamic programming Language

|     static programming Language  | Dynamic programming Language  |
| --- | --- |
| perform type checking at compile time | perform type checking at runtime  |
| Error will show at compile time  | Error will not show till  at program run |
| Declare data type before you use it | no need to declare datatype of variable  |
| more control  | save time in writing code but might give  errors at runtime |

# Garbage collection

- Garbage collection is an object with  no reference objects
- dynamic programming usage on reference variables and object
